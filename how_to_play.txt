Connect four game for:
2 players
player vs ai or
ai vs ai, which is pretty boring. 

Running the game——————

There are 3 main steps of running the game:

Run ai.py in shell
Define 2 players
Start the game by calling connect_four function.



Parameters for Player = Type of checker (must be X or O)
Parameters for AIPlayer = Type of checker (must be X or O), Tiebreak, to tell it what to do in case it can’t decide. ( must be LEFT, RIGHT or RANDOM), Lookahead, tell the player how many moves it has to predict, aka depth of its reach tree. (Must be an integer >=0)


Ex human vs ai:
Run ai.py in shell

>>> bob = Player(“O”)
>>> pc = AIPayer(“X”, “RANDOM”, 3)
>>> connect_four(bob, pc)


————————————————
AI player uses a BFS tree. It assumes its opponent does the best possible move for each of its own possible move. Check the code in ai.py for more details.
